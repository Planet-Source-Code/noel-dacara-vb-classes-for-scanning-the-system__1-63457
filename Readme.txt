VB6 CLASSES FOR SCANNING THE SYSTEM

3 classes in vb6 for scanning the registry, files/folders, and running processes in the system...the easy way.
fully configurable with extended features and stability that you really don't wanna miss.
this would be a good start for making anti-spywares, anti-virus programs, and more.
included in each of the 3 demos are 3 more classes for advance registry access, crc32 calculation, and getting file icon from executable and dll files.
also included is a piece of code so that you can provide viewers a link to your code in PSC without knowing the URL.
